Parallelization of Lossless Data Compression

Data compression is an important process to allow for memory savings. There are two main
types of compression algorithms lossless and lossy. Lossless algorithms ensure that there is no loss of data
during the encoding and decoding of data. Lossy can result in lost data after encoding and decoding data.
We will be exploring the parallelization of Huffman coding a popular lossless compression algorithm. The
goal of this project is to improve the speed of encoding or decoding data using Huffman coding.
